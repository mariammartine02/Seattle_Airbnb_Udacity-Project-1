# Unlocking Seattle's Airbnb Gems: Your Guide to the Best Places to Visit

# Libraries Utilized
For this project, I employed the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) framework, utilizing a combination of numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and emoji libraries. Specifically, numpy facilitated numerical operations, pandas was instrumental for data manipulation and analysis, matplotlib enabled data visualization, seaborn supported statistical data visualization, and emoji aided in handling emojis within text data. The workflow encompassed business understanding, data understanding, data preparation, data visualization, and conclusion stages. The integration of these libraries enhanced the efficiency and effectiveness of the CRISP-DM process, ultimately contributing to informed decision-making.


# Data Source: Seattle Airbnb
Since 2008, Airbnb has provided guests and hosts with the opportunity to experience travel in a more personalized and unique manner. As part of the Airbnb Inside initiative, the dataset utilized below provides insights into the listing activity of homestays in Seattle, WA. This dataset includes:
